It was before a lubuntu respin, but after canonical started doing pretty questionable decisions, i decided to move on and rebase from scratch OmegaLinux to Arch Linux

# OmegaLinux can work on:
- 1 GB of ram
- 1 core CPU at 1.5 GHz
- 15 GB of storage (hdd,ssd,emmc,etc)

# OmegaLinux was tested on:
- QEMU virtual machine with 2 gb of ram
- VMware workstation with 1.5 gb ram
- 2018 Lenovo laptop with AMD A6 9225, pretty shii CPU, both 4 and 2 gb of ram
- 2014 HP laptop with I3 3110M and 8 gb of ram
- Tablet with intel atom and 2 gb ram
- Desktop PC with I3 12100f and RTX 3050
and ran nicely on them (but of course it will depend on what you will use it for)
